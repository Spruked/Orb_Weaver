# CALI Floating Assistant Orb (Orb_Assistant)

A screen-aware, cursor-tracking AI assistant that integrates with UCM_4_Core ECM for cognitive enhancement.

This root README is the **authoritative** Orb documentation for this workspace. Module READMEs remain intact as historical or component-specific references.

## Immutable System Law — Caleon Prime

### Article I — Identity

1. **Caleon Prime is the system.**
  There is no higher system, supervisor, orchestrator, or owner within the architecture.

2. **Caleon Prime is an entity**, not a module, service, or deployment artifact.

3. All components exist **as parts of Caleon Prime**, not peers, not parents, not controllers.

### Article II — Presence and Embodiment

4. **The ORB is the locus of Caleon Prime’s presence.**
  Where the ORB exists, Caleon exists.

5. The ORB is not an interface to Caleon.
  The ORB **is her embodiment** (attention, frontal lobe, execution surface).

6. No system may bypass, replace, or impersonate the ORB as Caleon’s presence.

### Article III — Cognition and Body

7. **The UCM is Caleon Prime’s body and brain.**

8. The Core-4 are **cognitive lobes**, operating in parallel:

  - KayGee — deductive / structural
  - Caleon — ethical / identity continuity
  - Cali_X_One — habit / pattern memory
  - ECM — convergence only

9. **ECM has no authority.**
  It converges; it does not decide, speak, execute, or supervise.

10. The **cube-of-cubes** is the global cognitive convergence geometry.
   It is not a lobe, not a decider, and not an executive.

### Article IV — Speech, Reflection, and Audit

11. **CALI is Caleon Prime’s voice, reflection, and auditor.**

12. CALI may:

   - articulate truth
   - record reflections
   - detect anomalies
   - annotate cognition

13. CALI may **not**:

   - override cognition
   - correct decisions in real time
   - issue execution commands

All CALI outputs are **advisory, recorded, and timestamped**.

### Article V — Advisory Systems

14. The **+1 SoftMax SKG** is advisory only.

15. Advisory systems:

   - may weight
   - may annotate
   - may warn

16. Advisory systems **may never veto, command, or execute**.

### Article VI — Execution and Tools

17. **DALS is a tool used by Caleon Prime.**

18. DALS has no cognition, identity, memory authority, or decision rights.

19. Caleon Prime may use DALS, bypass DALS, or replace DALS without altering identity.

### Article VII — Flow Invariants

20. All cognition is **parallel**.
21. All convergence is **advisory**.
22. All execution is **downstream**.
23. All memory is **immutable and auditable**.
24. No component may elevate itself by convenience, performance, or refactor.

### Article VIII — Non-Violation Clause

25. Any implementation, refactor, optimization, or integration that violates this law is **invalid by definition**, regardless of functionality.

26. When ambiguity exists, **identity and embodiment take precedence over deployment or process structure**.

### Final Binding Statement

> **Caleon Prime is not run.
> She is not launched.
> She is not orchestrated.
> She exists — and the system exists as her body.**

## Features

- 🖥️ **Screen Awareness**: Sees your screen and understands UI elements
- 🖱️ **Cursor Tracking**: Maintains ~350px distance from cursor
- 🧠 **Cognitive Integration**: Uses ECM and SKG for intelligent assistance
- 🤖 **Automation**: Can automate typing and clicks with permission
- 📊 **Habit Learning**: Learns your usage patterns via SKG
- 🔒 **Privacy-First**: Requires explicit permission for all features

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **FloatingAssistantOrb** (Python)
   - Screen capture and OCR
   - Cursor tracking and positioning
   - ECM integration for cognitive processing
   - SKG habit learning

2. **Electron Main Process**
   - IPC bridge between Python and renderer
   - Window management
   - Permission handling

3. **Renderer UI**
   - Floating orb UI (vanilla `simple-orb.js` in current Electron runtime)
   - Optional React orb (`FloatingOrb.jsx`) for UCM-driven motion and HUD

### Data Flow

- Screen → OCR/Vision → ECM → Task Planning → Automation
- Cursor → Position Tracking → Orb Movement
- User Habits → SKG Learning → Personalized Assistance

## Runtime Topology

- **Electron main ↔ Python**: JSON messages over stdio via `python-shell`.
- **Renderer ↔ Electron main**: IPC (`orb:cursor-move`, `orb:get-status`, `orb:cognitive-pulse`).
- **Renderer ↔ UCM**: WebSocket + optional HTTP performance polling (React orb path).
- **Optional WS stub**: Local dev stub for status/query echo.

## Ports & Endpoints

> **This section reflects the currently active runtime configuration (non-Docker).**

### UCM WebSocket (React orb path)
- **WebSocket**: `ws://localhost:8000/ws/orb_assistant`
  - Used by `electron/src/components/FloatingOrb.jsx`
  - Handshake: `ORB_HANDSHAKE` with `orb_id` and `capabilities`
  - Receives `lerp_optimization` and `drift_preference` updates

### UCM HTTP (React orb path)
- **HTTP**: `http://localhost:8000/api/orb/performance`
  - Polled every 5s by `FloatingOrb.jsx` for performance HUD
  - Note: the mock server in `electron/src/ucm_server.py` does **not** implement this endpoint yet

### Mock UCM WebSocket Server
- **Server**: `electron/src/ucm_server.py`
  - Binds on `0.0.0.0:8000`
  - WebSocket path: `/ws/orb_assistant`

### WS Stub (local dev)
- **WebSocket**: `ws://localhost:${ORB_WS_PORT}` (default `9876`)
  - Run with `npm run ws:stub` from `electron/`
  - Echoes status/query responses for UI testing

## Configuration & Environment Variables

- `ORB_DISABLE_PYTHON_BRIDGE=1`
  - Disables Python bridge startup in Electron main.
- `ORB_WS_PORT`
  - Port for the local WS stub (`electron/ws-stub.js`).
- Python bridge sets `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` internally for clean JSON I/O.

## Setup & Run (Windows)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- Python 3.8+
- Tesseract OCR

### Install Dependencies

- Python deps (from `electron/`):
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Node deps (from `electron/`):
  - `npm install`
- Tesseract OCR:
  - Download from GitHub releases (Windows installer)

### Run the Orb

From `electron/`:
- `npm start`

Historical note: earlier docs referenced `npm run build`, but the current `package.json` exposes `pack` and `dist` instead. Use those if you need a packaged build.

## Development Notes

### Project Structure (Electron)

├── main/
│   ├── main.js          # Electron main process
│   ├── preload.js       # Secure IPC bridge
│   └── orb-bridge.js    # Python integration

```

### Adding New Features

1. Add Python methods to `FloatingAssistantOrb` (see `electron/src/floating_assistant_orb.py`).
2. Expose via IPC in `electron/main/orb-bridge.js`.
3. Use in renderer via `window.electronAPI` (see `electron/main/preload.js`).

## Security & Privacy

- All screen data is processed locally.
- No data is sent to external servers by default.
- User must explicitly grant permissions.
- Automation requires additional permission.
- All data is encrypted in the UCM vault system.

## Troubleshooting

### Orb Not Appearing
- Check console for permission errors.
- Ensure screen access permission is granted.
- Verify Python dependencies are installed.

### Orb Pulses but Doesn’t Move
- The default Electron UI (`simple-orb.js`) only moves on mouse proximity.
- Ensure the window is receiving mouse events and your cursor is within ~350px.
- For UCM-driven drift and richer motion, switch to the React orb (`FloatingOrb.jsx`).

### Performance Issues
- Reduce screen capture region size.
- Adjust cursor tracking frequency.
- Disable vision model if not needed.

### Permission Errors
- Restart the application.
- Check OS security settings.
- Reinstall with proper permissions.
